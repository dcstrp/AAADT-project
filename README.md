# Scope of this project
This project was elaborated in the scope of the first-year subject of Algorithms and Abstract Data Types. The aim of this project was to develop a program in C that would allow for the extraction of data related to the incidence of COVID-19 in a certain country.

To do so, a command interpreter was implemented so the end-user could use any of the underlying commands to obtain several different types of information,
mainly statistical information.
